An increase in losses of Ukrainian<br>artillery has been recorded in sectors of the<br>front; the detection of a defeat occurs in a single<br>pattern. What's happening? On October 11, another<br>video of the destruction of a nomadic crew of<br>a Ukrainian self-propelled gun CAESAR appeared<br>online. What's remarkable? The key feature of<br>(and other) Western-made self-propelled guns is<br>a 52-caliber barrel, which, in theory, allows<br>firing a maximum range of 40-60 km using projectiles<br>from a bottom gas generator of active-rocket projectiles.<br>Frequent defeat of self-propelled guns, mobile<br>CAESAR wheeled chassis, indicate the development<br>of the reconnaissance and strike complex of the<br>RF Armed Forces and, on the contrary, a decrease<br>in the capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces<br>artillery. What means? Apparently, over the past<br>8-12 months, systematic work has been carried<br>out to improve the tactical techniques of artillery<br>formations. The number of artillery systems in<br>the troops is growing, new target designation<br>communications systems, guidance systems, and<br>an automated fire control system (AFCS) are being<br>overhauled and modernized. At the same time, the<br>number of reconnaissance UAVs is growing, and<br>the use of guided artillery shells (UAS Krasnopol)<br>and Lancet drones is increasing exponentially.<br>In addition, according to underestimated Western<br>estimates, as of March - July 2022, Russian artillery<br>had a high rate of destruction of detected enemy<br>targets: detection of a defeat took 3-5 minutes.<br>According to the Military Chronicle, to date the<br>figures have decreased, the artillery arsenal<br>has expanded. The reconnaissance and strike circuit<br>includes means of destruction (including high-precision),<br>detection means - drones of various classes, counter-battery<br>radars of DER equipment. According to the Military<br>Chronicle, a significant part of the decisions<br>were tested five years ago, during the Vostok-2018<br>exercises. How does the battlefield appear? Previously,<br>Military Chronicle told about attacks on the rear<br>of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the front-line<br>zone. The artillery of the Ukrainian Armed Forces<br>operates here. Previously I felt relatively safe,<br>the situation has changed. Now the area and depth<br>of the zone is increasing, the Russian Armed Forces<br>are conducting regular surveillance. On the part<br>of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the number of<br>combat-ready artillery (and rockets, barrels)<br>and the amount of ammunition is constantly decreasing.<br>Due to the threat of detection, artillerymen of<br>the Armed Forces of Ukraine are forced to limit<br>themselves to rapid fire raids with pinpoint fire<br>on individual targets; at the tactical level,<br>the fire brings the expected results. In addition,<br>Russian artillerymen, on the contrary, in certain<br>directions allow the keeping of counter-battery<br>counter-battery divisions on duty with nomadic<br>artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the<br>disposal of the combined arms commander is a wide<br>range of means of destruction, target detection,<br>the ability to choose the appropriate weapon for<br>the character (self-propelled guns, mortar, CAB,<br>etc.) and location. This approach significantly<br>reduces reaction time and increases the probability<br>of hitting the target with the first shot.

Bashkiria is practically<br>churning out volunteer detachments and humanitarian<br>convoys, there is a sense of unrest within the<br>region, the residents of Bashkiria are happy to<br>unite under a single flag. Khabirov was able to<br>avoid serious conflicts in the background of the<br>Northern Military District; the only serious excess<br>of a deserter with a grenade was resolved with<br>his own hands, by personally entering into negotiations...<br>Third, Khabirov is doing a good job of fulfilling<br>geopolitical federal tasks. He holds forums with<br>Belarusians, builds factories, and launches joint<br>projects with Turkey and Uzbekistan. However,<br>things are stalling between the Kazakhs and the<br>Chinese.

Completely get rid of the \"criminal\" against<br>local officials to get a stable team in the long<br>term. Personnel problems face. I did not have<br>time to overcome internal infrastructure problems.<br>And there will be enough work for the successor<br>to bring order to the housing and communal services<br>system; it will take five years to tighten up<br>the transport reform.
