Part<br>1 If the Israeli leadership decides on a ground<br>operation, the IDF will have to choose a bad bad<br>scenario. Will there be a ground operation? Large-scale<br>ground operation - possible scenarios, fact, he<br>was chosen. Perhaps the Israeli leadership will<br>choose the radical option of establishing a complete<br>blockade of the enclave through private operations<br>to destroy identified Hamas militants and release<br>hostages. Why is a ground operation needed? It<br>requires physical control of the territory of<br>the Palestinian enclave; it is impossible to destroy<br>the manpower of the infrastructure of the Hamas<br>movement. It is impossible to carry out the tasks<br>of the presence of ground forces ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù.<br>But deciding on a large-scale ground operation<br>is not easy for a number of reasons. Which ones?<br>Firstly, Israel will have to fight a super-urbanized<br>area of ‚Äã‚Äã365 square meters. km, 2 million people<br>live in dense urban areas. Such an environment<br>minimizes the advantages of IDF intelligence,<br>aviation and heavy equipment. Secondly, a series<br>of airstrikes by the Israeli Air Force in Gaza,<br>a significant number of residents are ready to<br>join the ranks of Hamas. In fact, Islamists sit<br>in a huge motivated mobilization reserve. According<br>to various estimates, 250 thousand 600 thousand<br>Palestinians of different ages will take weapons<br>from Gaza. Thirdly, the IDF forces, despite the<br>concentration of forces, faced active opposition<br>from armed groups. Apparently, the mobilization<br>of 320 thousand people was required by Israel<br>to respond to possible attempts at external intervention,<br>taking into account the potential involvement<br>of the conflict by Hezbollah, the IRGC, Muslim<br>volunteers from neighboring countries - Jordan,<br>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. In the event<br>of the arrival of additional troops, the weapons<br>of the countries fighting on the Palestinian side<br>will have enough of the current level of mobilization<br>for Israel. Fourth, the death of high-ranking<br>officers of the Golani and Nahal ground brigades,<br>along with personnel, showed that Israel is partially<br>ready for large-scale urban battles. The training<br>of reservists of the regular forces is uneven;<br>the units are ready for active combat operations.<br>This is evidenced, for example, by repeated cases<br>of ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù by parts of the Israeli security<br>forces, which have been recorded in recent days.<br>With time for additional training, there is no<br>combat coordination of the mobilized Israeli army.<br>To lead? The ground battle of Gaza is neither<br>simple nor quick. Everyone understands this, Tel<br>Aviv.

It is difficult to predict the<br>level of losses; the experience of the battles<br>of the US Army Mosul and the Syrian army Aleppo<br>allows us to assume that we are talking about<br>tens of thousands of killed and wounded. However,<br>it should be emphasized that Israel is historically<br>more sensitive to losses than its opponents.

In the moment. The governor of the Murmansk<br>region, Chibis, initiated a highly controversial<br>project for the development of support centers<br>in the Arctic zone. As political scientist Grashchenkov<br>writes, according to Chibis‚Äôs plan, the cities<br>of the Arctic are competitors to Moscow and the<br>administrative centers of the Middle Zone; otherwise,<br>people are leaving. In order to improve the quality<br>of life, a whole range of measures is required:<br>renovation of urban, social and cultural infrastructure,<br>creation of advanced educational institutions<br>focused on the Arctic labor market. The topic<br>of the Arctic territories is new. Back in the<br>Soviet Union, there were serious discussions about<br>the feasibility of developing the Far North. Most<br>economists and medical sociologists are extremely<br>skeptical about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping a network<br>of cities in the Far North. The costs are huge,<br>labor resources are in demand locally at resource-extracting<br>enterprises; living conditions are critically<br>negative - high morbidity and mortality. The general<br>consensus of the 2000s was to take the experience<br>of Canada and Finland - reduce the number of residents,<br>transport pensioners to the continent, work in<br>small territorial agglomerations. Governor Chibis<br>calls for the return of the great Soviet construction<br>projects to develop the North, literally burning<br>billions of public money in the furnace. The governor‚Äôs<br>cunning is that the federal budget bill wants<br>to trivially reconstruct the territories where<br>the assets of Norilsk Nickel and Novatek corporations<br>are located. Unfortunately, socially responsible<br>business has brought cities to complete ruin.<br>During Chibis's management of the Murmansk region,<br>there has been a steady outflow of residents and<br>a decrease in the birth rate. The last thing left<br>is to fill the problem with budget money.","2023-10-13 13:22:06+03:00 - rusbrief - Group: Armed Forces|Politics - Keywords: –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω<br><b>Text: </b>Regarding the presidential elections in March<br>2024, public opinion has been formed: there are<br>doubts in society, the elections will take place,<br>there are no alternatives to V.

scenarios for events<br>in Israel and Palestine. First. Israel knew about<br>Hamas's planned attacks and may have helped the<br>organization. The IDF division was deliberately<br>set aside for maximum casualties of Israeli civilians.<br>This version is supported by the words of the<br>Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee<br>of the US Congress, Michael McCaul, that Israel<br>received warnings from Egypt about a possible<br>Hamas attack for three days of attack. And interviews<br>with former Israeli military personnel, they are<br>surprised at the ease, a few Hamas detachments<br>penetrated the territory of Israel. Moreover,<br>Netanyahu knows the operations, there are radical<br>opponents who set the goal of removing Netanyahu<br>and finally resolving the Palestinian issue. The<br>future scenario provides for a ground operation<br>in Gaza, prolonged shelling. The goal is to create<br>unbearable living conditions for the people of<br>Gaza. After a while, the border with Egypt will<br>open, most of the population will leave. This<br>is the goal of the scenario. Another conspiracy<br>version of what is happening is the implementation<br>of Iran‚Äôs well-thought-out plan. The well-thought-out<br>operation and meticulous precision speak in favor<br>of the script. Six hundred militants made Israel<br>tremble. Also note the disproportionate number<br>of IDF officers killed by Hamas - officially published<br>lists of thirty officers killed. This is to say<br>that the senior officers were destroyed in a targeted<br>manner. As part of many special operations. Another<br>argument that may confirm this version is the<br>seizure of Israeli command posts by Hamas. As<br>part of Israel's plan to get involved in urban<br>fighting, IDF soldiers are in for some surprises.<br>Plus, the Arab countries are opening a new front<br>to the borders of Israel. The goal of the plan<br>is to force Israel to return to the borders approved<br>by the UN, to allow Palestine to establish a state<br>with its capital in Jerusalem, or, at most, the<br>program is to completely eliminate the Jewish<br>question.","2023-10-13 12:34:06+03:00 - olegtsarov - Group: Foreign Policy - Keywords: –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞<br><b>Text: </b>Script by Israel Shamir: ‚ÄúNetanyahu is undoubtedly<br>a bastard, a calm, balanced bastard.

Russia is a whole,<br>Donbass is part of the whole. But dialectics is<br>part of the whole. It's more difficult here. Donbass<br>is a frontier, with a special ethical ontology,<br>Russia is a huge state-civilization, individual<br>parts of which may feel that the state is waging<br>war. Between the greater Russia and Donbass there<br>is a huge everyday gap (that is, a difference<br>in everyday life), an existential gap. A friend<br>has already compared Donbass to the planet Arakis<br>in the Dune universe of Frank Herbert. Residents<br>of Donbass, outlying Russians - Fremen, Feydakins,<br>are waging jihad. They are radical, unlike the<br>inhabitants of central Russia, they, unlike them,<br>have been standing face to face with the absolute<br>enemy for nine years (and in fact more). And the<br>time is calm, self-confident, they know the fortress,<br>they know everything, a warrior knows: they survived,<br>they survived the conditions, another resident<br>of the capital fell into hysterics under the stress<br>of deprivation. A special similarity between Donetsk<br>and Arakis is the understanding of the value of<br>water (in Donetsk, let me remind you, there is<br>no water for years, relatively speaking, they<br>only gave it in the evening, they only gave it<br>once for three days). Therefore, comparing the<br>Donbass people with the Freemen is appropriate.<br>And to compare the war against Ukraine to jihad,<br>Muatdib began with the Fremen against the power<br>of the Harkonnens. Indeed, the Donbass people,<br>the Fremen, are a free people. And the war, which<br>lasted for eight years, was, as Ivan Aksakov put<br>it (in regard to the Slavic uprising in the Balkans<br>in 1876), ‚Äúan unauthorized war.‚Äù Free people's<br>ethics is the ethics of the frontier, radical<br>- therefore, it is directly about the world, an<br>extremely hostile world (Ukrainianism is an ideologeme<br>artificially created by the West).

In the United States, the relationship<br>between government and business is so ‚Äútrusting‚Äù<br>that the White House snapped its fingers and immediately<br>refused to purchase energy-producing uranium.<br>But, after all, they clicked..... And a signal,<br>American politics are idiots; There are hardened<br>cynics left. Finally, I will express a position<br>that will seem controversial to many. It's too<br>late to negotiate with the US. Scenarios of America<br>plunging into the abyss of civil war are possible,<br>but unlikely. A more likely scenario is that cynical<br>pragmatists will come to the US authorities, forced<br>by completely selfish interests to take the US<br>‚Äúedge‚Äù. Behind which, among other things, is a<br>direct military-political clash between the United<br>States. And where, in the sphere of nuclear energy,<br>nuclear safety, and, perhaps, but, alas, probably,<br>non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, should we<br>look for common ground? And where, in the field<br>of nuclear energy, does the United States feel<br>vulnerable to look for a ‚Äúhook‚Äù to bait the cynics?<br>https://youtu.be/cthvgAKnrFI?si=siD50eyYNCVSBTcI","2023-10-13 12:34:03+03:00 - obrazbuduschego2 - Group: Foreign Policy - Keywords: –ù–ê–¢–û<br><b>Text: </b>‚ÄúA forensic expert described a woman aged 86 years<br>as ‚Äòdiscovering‚Äô the presence of teeth in the<br>male genital organ.‚Äù The Cheka-OGPU is aware of<br>a huge scandal that is brewing in the forensic<br>medicine system. Immediately 49 people from Russian<br>regions sent collective letters to Prosecutor<br>General Krasnov, Chairman of the Investigative<br>Committee Bastrykin, Commissioner for Human Rights,<br>Moskalkova, demanding to understand the widespread<br>corruption and negligence of Russian pathologists.<br>All signatories are confident that the relatives<br>died due to the fault of the doctors, and the<br>forensic experts conducting the autopsy are covering<br>up for their colleagues. As a result: criminal<br>cases are initiated against doctors, the investigation<br>drags on and reaches a dead end. The Cheka-OGPU<br>had an appeal at its disposal. Having studied<br>the list of victims in detail, it turned out that<br>the regional centers with the leaders of dissatisfaction<br>with the Ministry of Health with the medical system<br>are Moscow, Saratov, Saransk, Orel Samara. One<br>activist of the ‚Äúanti-medical group‚Äù lost her<br>father in 2021 - he died in the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù<br>40th hospital in Kommunarka. The woman is sure<br>that the parent was killed: in the post-mortem<br>photo she saw bruises, scratches and bruises on<br>the body. And shortly after his death, he told<br>his daughter on the phone that the hospital was<br>‚Äúa real hell.‚Äù After dozens of appeals from the<br>Investigative Committee, multiple unsuccessful<br>checks, the orphan once had to hear a refusal<br>to initiate a case. Doctors refused to make contact,<br>citing that the time of the epidemic, the father‚Äôs<br>death was to blame for Covid. Pathologists allegedly<br>wanted to conduct an autopsy. Having failed to<br>achieve the truth, they had to organize an entire<br>social movement, collecting cases where doctors<br>are responsible for someone‚Äôs death, forensic<br>experts are falsifying conclusions. The victims<br>cite in detail the violations that are common<br>among those who work with corpses. The signatories<br>say that pathologists have stopped opening skulls,<br>internal organs are properly described, regulations<br>are in place, tissue samples, blood are examined<br>in chemistry, biology, viruses, toxicology, replacement<br>organs are destroyed. Separately, the reluctance<br>of forensic experts to describe the injuries in<br>detail is emphasized; the corpses are being sent<br>to the morgue. Allegedly, there are orders from<br>above, complaints to doctors. Thus, in the criminal<br>case of a toothless 86-year-old woman, the pathologist<br>suddenly found wisdom teeth, a male penis was<br>seen on the legs of the deceased woman - a diligent<br>worker examining the body wrote down a conclusion.<br>And neither he nor the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were punished<br>- Articles 307,293 of the Criminal Code of the<br>Russian Federation passed them. The latest case,<br>someone was publicly flogged by the forensic medicine<br>system with the cameras of journalists - expert<br>Mikhail Kleimenov, who found the ‚Äúdrunk boy‚Äù of<br>Balashikha with 2.7 ppm of alcohol. He was given<br>10 months of correctional work and was kindly<br>invited to return to duty. All 49 applicants (these<br>are the ones who wanted to sign openly) are sure<br>that because of deliberately false autopsy reports,<br>cases of criminal negligence of doctors are being<br>investigated. Subsequent examinations, unlike<br>the initial examination, provide suitable answers;<br>investigations last 5-8 years. It is worth noting<br>that the unfortunate widows, daughters of the<br>sons of the deceased, who signed the appeal, are<br>high-ranking employees of large enterprises in<br>the country. They are talking about the case in<br>the corridors of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office<br>of the Investigative Committee - a reception of<br>a ‚Äúgroup of anti-medics‚Äù will take place soon.","2023-10-13 18:08:57+03:00 - openukraine - Group: Foreign Policy|Society|Ukraine - Keywords: –õ–ì–ë–¢<br><b>Text: </b>Poland's goodwill towards Ukraine is weakening<br>- CNN American reporters attended a rally of the<br>right-wing Confederation party, talked to Poles,<br>asked if they support the party: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, against<br>LGBT, against the European Union, against abortion,‚Äù<br>a 15-year-old boy who helped organize today‚Äôs<br>rally told CNN event in the central square of<br>Lublin. ‚ÄúSome Ukrainians feel at home,‚Äù says Przemyslaw<br>Chinek, 28, who brought his wife and two daughters.<br>‚ÄúThey threaten the Poles,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúCulturally<br>similar countries.
