Instead<br>of the first versions of Qassam missiles, Hamas<br>used technologically advanced missiles: they targeted<br>position areas of the Iron Dome air defense system,<br>hit residential buildings in Israeli cities, and<br>used military targets. How were the Palestinians<br>able to prepare so many rockets? Since the time<br>of the first versions of the Qassam missiles,<br>factories for the production of unguided missiles<br>have been equipped with specially built underground<br>storage facilities for safety purposes. Part of<br>it is located 20-40 deep in the residential areas<br>of the Gaza Strip, with the help of a system of<br>tunnels, presumably, the territory of Egypt was<br>excavated. The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHamas' \"military<br>factories\" is supposedly 50 thousand square meters.<br>m. These underground workshops are equipped with<br>CNC metalworking machines, ventilation systems<br>for removing combustion products, which facilitates<br>the work of duty shifts and complicates the detection<br>of objects. The IDF repeatedly struck targets<br>and succeeded in completely disrupting the missile<br>production chain. Why do the Palestinians calmly<br>use rockets? Launches of unguided missiles turned<br>out to be possible due to a developed underground<br>network; the missiles hit the launcher. The launcher<br>itself is disguised; the launch time opens; a<br>break is taken in use. Presumably, Hamas has built<br>positional areas in the largest cities of Gaza,<br>the southern regions of Abasan, Khirbat Ihzaa,<br>Khan Yunis, Al-Mawasi, and the northeastern regions<br>of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya Umm al-Nasr. According<br>to some reports, through the tunnels of the launch<br>areas in the north and south, a special transport<br>hub allows the transportation of missiles from<br>assembly lines to launch positions. What is the<br>range of the missiles? Most early Palestinian<br>rockets had a range of significantly 20 km. However,<br>in 2014, Hamas made significant progress: the<br>active development of its own technologies and<br>the introduction of foreign solutions (primarily<br>Iranian Chinese) made it possible to increase<br>the missile launch range to 80-120 km. Taking<br>into account the short distance from Gaza, it<br>is enough for Israel to hit targets almost at<br>the point of Israel, the relatively remote cities<br>of Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Hebron, the nuclear<br>center of Dimona, and the vast majority of Israeli<br>military bases. @MChroniclesBot - send photos<br>and videos of the front.‚ò†Ô∏è Military Chronicleüíô<br>Military Chronicle VK","2023-10-10 19:03:41+03:00 - sladkov_plus - Group: Foreign Policy - Keywords: –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞<br><b>Text: </b>üöÄ Introducing the cool channel Pro CosmosAdvanced<br>technologies scientific discoveries of primary<br>sources.

According to him, ‚ÄúNetanyahu<br>has clarified the next stages of the war, received<br>the unconditional support of Western governments,<br>to do what is necessary for as long as it will<br>take, to ‚Äúdefend Israel.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe administration<br>of US President Joe Biden went further, providing<br>Israel with weapons and ammunition, sending the<br>modern advanced aircraft carrier Ford along with<br>destroyers to the Eastern Mediterranean, strengthening<br>the forces stationed in the region, sufficient<br>to start World War III,‚Äù the publication says.<br>It considers ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs incentive to be political<br>\"But Netanyahu's fanatical ministers may have<br>more in mind regarding the deployment of US troops<br>that goes beyond military deterrence political<br>positioning.\" He will try to expand the scope<br>of the war to include Iran,‚Äù writes the author<br>of the article. ‚ÄúDespite the bluster of bravado,<br>Netanyahu‚Äôs attack on Iran has the green light<br>of US support. But Israel's bloody attacks are<br>a game-changer, giving Netanyahu the opportunity<br>to pursue plans to crush Iran by deceiving the<br>Biden administration into going to war,‚Äù writes<br>Marwan Bishara. He believes it is not easy to<br>involve the US in a conflict with Iran, given<br>Biden's desire to end ‚Äúforever wars‚Äù, the humiliating<br>withdrawal of Afghanistan in 2021. But, less likely,<br>there is a possibility. And Bishara describes<br>the scenario to happen. ‚ÄúAs the accusation of<br>participation in the attack against the role of<br>Tehran is fully formulated by Israel, the US tried<br>to apply pressure by demanding the release of<br>Israeli prisoners taken by Hamas. If Iran refuses<br>and decides to use Hezbollah as leverage against<br>Israel, provoking a wider confrontation will lead<br>the US to likely intervention,‚Äù the author of<br>the article writes.","2023-10-10 12:24:29+03:00 - skurlatovlive - Group: Foreign Policy - Keywords: –°–®–ê<br><b>Text: </b>Israel is the forerunner of the end. Just as John<br>in the Old Testament was the harbinger of the<br>birth of Christ, Hamas today is the anti-John<br>of modern Israel. Many analysts, uv. D. Svetin,<br>correctly recall the history of the emergence<br>of the Jewish state, briefly describing the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù<br>of the attempt to replay the destined fate of<br>the Israeli people, who were known to be doomed<br>by the betrayal of Judah, eternal wanderings on<br>Earth, gaining state sovereignty. And the elaboration<br>of the ‚Äúissue‚Äù by the British during the Second<br>World War resulted in a formal revival of the<br>‚ÄúKingdom of Israel.‚Äù Do not discuss the motives<br>of Stalin, who played a decisive role in the birth<br>of the Jewish state, which Jews deeply revere.<br>I will say that the highest ‚Äúcherished‚Äù destinations<br>are the geopolitical problem of preserving political<br>subjectivity. An instructive lesson - Israel has<br>paid the price for the tolerance game of kind<br>gestures. No good deed goes unpunished, good brings<br>good, the destruction of evil in the face of the<br>enemy who has prepared your destruction is cruel<br>and terrible in no measure. All conflicts are<br>irremovable in the world and drive the existence<br>of things. It would seem that the surest way to<br>extinguish a conflict is for the side to destroy<br>the other. Let's say, the Palestinian Arabs oppose<br>the Israeli Jews, the Jews are stronger militarily,<br>is it better for the Jews to deport the Arab Muslims<br>of Israel who are resisting with arms and eliminate<br>them? A number of successful rulers of the East<br>and West acted in the past in a way that cemented<br>the state. So, in a word, destroy the fascist<br>junta. Totally, by annexing the territory of Ukraine<br>to the Russian Federation, destroying neo-Banderaism<br>together with Ukrainian statehood forever. It<br>is more difficult for the US rulers to cope with<br>all sorts of BLM opponents of the ‚Äúwhites‚Äù. All<br>‚Äúdescendants of slaves‚Äù ‚Äúbranded with a curse‚Äù<br>seek to ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù centuries of suppression, exploitation<br>of discrimination by ‚Äúwhites‚Äù (WASP - ‚Äúwhite Anglo-Saxon<br>Protestant‚Äù), demolition of monuments to the founding<br>fathers of the United States. What to do with<br>the rebellious ‚Äúcoloreds‚Äù? After all, latent,<br>it is written on the forehead, against the foundations<br>of the history of American statehood. Within the<br>framework of the liberal world order, conflicts<br>are insoluble in principle. Neither the US nor<br>Israel will stand. But the states will survive,<br>following liberal utopian hopes and national realistic<br>interests. The USSR survived, the rulers decided<br>to eliminate the liberals, the PRC survived and<br>succeeded, deciding to suppress the liberals of<br>Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.","2023-10-10 23:30:33+03:00 - oldlentach - Group: Ukraine - Keywords: –ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π<br><b>Text: </b>And the news of the hour: ‚Ä¢ Zelensky announced<br>a new grain corridor from Moldova to Romania;<br>‚Ä¢ Russians were detained in Bulgaria for smuggling<br>military products; ‚Ä¢ Finland committed sabotage<br>as the cause of a leak in the Estonian gas pipeline;<br>‚Ä¢ The Central Bank announced the presentation<br>of new banknotes 1000 5000 rubles","2023-10-10 22:58:07+03:00 - oldlentach - Group: Foreign Policy|Armed Forces - Keywords: –°–®–ê<br><b>Text: </b>Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The strikes<br>continue to be carried out despite the fact that<br>Israeli aircraft are actively searching for launchers<br>and destroying targets inside the Gaza Strip.<br>How many rockets did Hamas fire at Israel? Since<br>October 7, the Palestinians have fired an estimated<br>2,500 unguided missiles at Israeli targets. Instead<br>of the first versions of Qassam missiles, Hamas<br>used technologically advanced missiles: they targeted<br>position areas of the Iron Dome air defense system,<br>hit residential buildings in Israeli cities, and<br>used military targets. How were the Palestinians<br>able to prepare so many rockets? Since the time<br>of the first versions of the Qassam missiles,<br>factories for the production of unguided missiles<br>have been equipped with specially built underground<br>storage facilities for safety purposes. Part of<br>it is located 20-40 deep in the residential areas<br>of the Gaza Strip, with the help of a system of<br>tunnels, presumably, the territory of Egypt was<br>excavated. The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHamas' \"military<br>factories\" is supposedly 50 thousand square meters.<br>m. These underground workshops are equipped with<br>CNC metalworking machines, ventilation systems<br>for removing combustion products, which facilitates<br>the work of duty shifts and complicates the detection<br>of objects. The IDF repeatedly struck targets<br>and succeeded in completely disrupting the missile<br>production chain. Why do the Palestinians calmly<br>use rockets? Launches of unguided missiles turned<br>out to be possible due to a developed underground<br>network; the missiles hit the launcher. The launcher<br>itself is disguised; the launch time opens; a<br>break is taken in use. Presumably, Hamas has built<br>positional areas in the largest cities of Gaza,<br>the southern regions of Abasan, Khirbat Ihzaa,<br>Khan Yunis, Al-Mawasi, and the northeastern regions<br>of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya Umm al-Nasr. According<br>to some reports, through the tunnels of the launch<br>areas in the north and south, a special transport<br>hub allows the transportation of missiles from<br>assembly lines to launch positions. What is the<br>range of the missiles? Most early Palestinian<br>rockets had a range of significantly 20 km. However,<br>in 2014, Hamas made significant progress: the<br>active development of its own technologies and<br>the introduction of foreign solutions (primarily<br>Iranian Chinese) made it possible to increase<br>the missile launch range to 80-120 km. Taking<br>into account the short distance from Gaza, it<br>is enough for Israel to hit targets almost at<br>the point of Israel, the relatively remote cities<br>of Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Hebron, the nuclear<br>center of Dimona, and the vast majority of Israeli<br>military bases. @MChroniclesBot - send photos<br>and videos of the front.‚ò†Ô∏è Military Chronicleüíô<br>Military Chronicle VK","2023-10-10 16:11:01+03:00 - sil0viki - Group: Politics - Keywords: –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω<br><b>Text: </b>üìÑMore than 1 million post-gasification agreements<br>have been concluded by Russian residents. ‚úîÔ∏è70%<br>of them, 700 thousand, have been completed. ‚ö°Ô∏èThe<br>technical ability to connect 1 million households<br>has been created.

The strikes<br>continue to be carried out despite the fact that<br>Israeli aircraft are actively searching for launchers<br>and destroying targets inside the Gaza Strip.<br>How many rockets did Hamas fire at Israel? Since<br>October 7, the Palestinians have fired an estimated<br>2,500 unguided missiles at Israeli targets. Instead<br>of the first versions of Qassam missiles, Hamas<br>used technologically advanced missiles: they targeted<br>position areas of the Iron Dome air defense system,<br>hit residential buildings in Israeli cities, and<br>used military targets. How were the Palestinians<br>able to prepare so many rockets? Since the time<br>of the first versions of the Qassam missiles,<br>factories for the production of unguided missiles<br>have been equipped with specially built underground<br>storage facilities for safety purposes. Part of<br>it is located 20-40 deep in the residential areas<br>of the Gaza Strip, with the help of a system of<br>tunnels, presumably, the territory of Egypt was<br>excavated. The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHamas' \"military<br>factories\" is supposedly 50 thousand square meters.<br>m. These underground workshops are equipped with<br>CNC metalworking machines, ventilation systems<br>for removing combustion products, which facilitates<br>the work of duty shifts and complicates the detection<br>of objects. The IDF repeatedly struck targets<br>and succeeded in completely disrupting the missile<br>production chain. Why do the Palestinians calmly<br>use rockets? Launches of unguided missiles turned<br>out to be possible due to a developed underground<br>network; the missiles hit the launcher. The launcher<br>itself is disguised; the launch time opens; a<br>break is taken in use. Presumably, Hamas has built<br>positional areas in the largest cities of Gaza,<br>the southern regions of Abasan, Khirbat Ihzaa,<br>Khan Yunis, Al-Mawasi, and the northeastern regions<br>of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya Umm al-Nasr. According<br>to some reports, through the tunnels of the launch<br>areas in the north and south, a special transport<br>hub allows the transportation of missiles from<br>assembly lines to launch positions. What is the<br>range of the missiles? Most early Palestinian<br>rockets had a range of significantly 20 km. However,<br>in 2014, Hamas made significant progress: the<br>active development of its own technologies and<br>the introduction of foreign solutions (primarily<br>Iranian Chinese) made it possible to increase<br>the missile launch range to 80-120 km. Taking<br>into account the short distance from Gaza, it<br>is enough for Israel to hit targets almost at<br>the point of Israel, the relatively remote cities<br>of Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Hebron, the nuclear<br>center of Dimona, and the vast majority of Israeli<br>military bases. \"Military Chronicle\"","2023-10-10 18:44:59+03:00 - swodki - Group: Ukraine - Keywords: –í–°–£<br><b>Text: </b>Patriotic blogger Max Divnich responded to Fridman's<br>return with a spectacular disposal of Alfa Bank's<br>card - the corrupt banker is happy in his homeland.<br>The \"triumphant\" return of Alfa Group co-owner<br>Mikhail Fridman's overexposure to Russia reminded<br>many Russians of the financial transactions of<br>ex-Russian oligarchs.

Hello, they are citizens<br>of the EU living in 27 beautiful countries. He's<br>leaving tomorrow, but, you see, he's gone. I must<br>say, Galkin‚Äôs appearance is pitiful. It looked<br>as if the last plane was late, sitting here in<br>a blooming Israeli garden, listening, the water<br>gurgling, coming up with a heroic explanation<br>for its presence. Yes, remember today‚Äôs footage<br>of the shelling of Ben-Gurion Airport and the<br>stampede, it becomes clear that Galkin will fly<br>away neither yesterday nor today. And tomorrow<br>it will fly away. The water continued to gurgle,<br>like a leaking toilet cistern, Galkin continued<br>to tell, he loves Israel, he is calm. This is<br>my homeland. He's Jewish to my mother. Here I<br>want to ask: ‚ÄúWho is dad? Is it really a lawyer?‚Äù<br>Galkin called the Israelis a united nation, admired<br>Israeli patriotism, it comes from the depths of<br>the hearts, is imposed on Russia, from above is<br>exaggerated Russian patriotism.

Admiring those,<br>there was an impulse to join the impulse. Otherwise<br>the words are worthless. Or rather, they cost<br>less, the murmur of the tank. Galkin caught the<br>trap and set it himself. He fled to Russia, spitting<br>patriotism, making it clear to the Russians that<br>the feeling of patriotism is the lot of uncouth<br>cattle. Israel got in. And Israel is facing a<br>difficult moment. And at this point, Israelis<br>are patriots. Go ahead and try to say that patriotism<br>is for the rednecks. They will tear it apart and<br>the pieces will roll into the back streets of<br>Tel Aviv. But say something! We need something<br>consistent. And Galkin emerges two patriotisms:<br>- exaggerated, us, - real, Israel. In principle,<br>the verbal twists are explainable. When Galkin<br>fled to Russia, I am sure that almighty America<br>within NATO will begin to bomb Moscow. And it<br>turned out that the missiles flew to Tel Aviv.<br>And Galkin is sure that Israel will intervene,<br>and the almighty America will wipe Gaza out of<br>the dust. Therefore, America swaggers, its faith<br>is unshakable. But Israel erased Gaza. And the<br>Israelis, patriots, went to defend the country.<br>‚ÄúDid you go?‚Äù ‚Äî subscribers asked Galkin a thousand<br>times. ‚ÄúThose, he asks, at the front...‚Äù he moved<br>on to a sensitive question. - I say that I served<br>the army for some reason, I went to defend Israel,<br>I went. But there is an opportunity to support<br>the country in a different way: donate blood.‚Äù<br>These are the words of the boy, the husband. While<br>they are fighting, Galkin donates blood. Then<br>the right to bear the proud title of patriot of<br>a small country that arose in one impulse will<br>get off with little loss. Here questions arise:<br>‚ÄúDid you stand up in a single impulse, did you<br>stand up?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd the abduction of women and children<br>into captivity is a reason to go defend the country?‚Äù<br>And finally: ‚ÄúDid you serve in the Russian army?‚Äù<br>Well, say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm middle-aged, sick, pathetic.
