Part<br>1 If the Israeli leadership decides on a ground<br>operation, the IDF will have to choose a bad bad<br>scenario. Will there be a ground operation? Large-scale<br>ground operation - possible scenarios, fact, he<br>was chosen. Perhaps the Israeli leadership will<br>choose the radical option of establishing a complete<br>blockade of the enclave through private operations<br>to destroy identified Hamas militants and release<br>hostages. Why is a ground operation needed? It<br>requires physical control of the territory of<br>the Palestinian enclave; it is impossible to destroy<br>the manpower of the infrastructure of the Hamas<br>movement. It is impossible to carry out the tasks<br>of the presence of ground forces ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù.<br>But deciding on a large-scale ground operation<br>is not easy for a number of reasons. Which ones?<br>Firstly, Israel will have to fight a super-urbanized<br>area of ‚Äã‚Äã365 square meters. km, 2 million people<br>live in dense urban areas. Such an environment<br>minimizes the advantages of IDF intelligence,<br>aviation and heavy equipment. Secondly, a series<br>of airstrikes by the Israeli Air Force in Gaza,<br>a significant number of residents are ready to<br>join the ranks of Hamas. In fact, Islamists sit<br>in a huge motivated mobilization reserve. According<br>to various estimates, 250 thousand 600 thousand<br>Palestinians of different ages will take weapons<br>from Gaza. Thirdly, the IDF forces, despite the<br>concentration of forces, faced active opposition<br>from armed groups. Apparently, the mobilization<br>of 320 thousand people was required by Israel<br>to respond to possible attempts at external intervention,<br>taking into account the potential involvement<br>of the conflict by Hezbollah, the IRGC, Muslim<br>volunteers from neighboring countries - Jordan,<br>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. In the event<br>of the arrival of additional troops, the weapons<br>of the countries fighting on the Palestinian side<br>will have enough of the current level of mobilization<br>for Israel. Fourth, the death of high-ranking<br>officers of the Golani and Nahal ground brigades,<br>along with personnel, showed that Israel is partially<br>ready for large-scale urban battles. The training<br>of reservists of the regular forces is uneven;<br>the units are ready for active combat operations.<br>This is evidenced, for example, by repeated cases<br>of ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù by parts of the Israeli security<br>forces, which have been recorded in recent days.<br>With time for additional training, there is no<br>combat coordination of the mobilized Israeli army.<br>To lead? The ground battle of Gaza is neither<br>simple nor quick. Everyone understands this, Tel<br>Aviv. The operation will require Israel to attract<br>significant resources - human, material and political.<br>In addition, the ground operation is, in general,<br>extremely bloody. It is difficult to predict the<br>level of losses; the experience of the battles<br>of the US Army Mosul and the Syrian army Aleppo<br>allows us to assume that we are talking about<br>tens of thousands of killed and wounded. However,<br>it should be emphasized that Israel is historically<br>more sensitive to losses than its opponents.

He is credited<br>with authoring the Hamas \"Flood Al-Aqsa\" campaign,<br>attacks by Palestinian militants. This is Mohammed<br>Deif, commander of the military wing of Hamas,<br>who survived, according to Reuters, seven assassination<br>attempts by the Israeli army. As a result, according<br>to the Financial Times, he lost an arm and leg<br>and ended up in a wheelchair; As a result of another,<br>according to Hamas sources, he lost an eye.

In 1989,<br>the Israeli military arrested a young man with<br>links to the Islamist movement and released him<br>for 16 months. Mohammed Deif's mentor is said<br>to be Yahya Ayash, who specialized in making bombs<br>and responded to a series of terrorist attacks<br>on Israeli buses in the mid-1990s. In 1996, Ayash<br>was killed, Deif, Israeli sources write, ‚Äúled<br>a wave of revenge.‚Äù He is credited with kidnapping,<br>killing soldiers in Israel and, as I wrote above,<br>developing plans for attacks.

Israel has three<br>photographs of Deif: two are 20 years old, the<br>third is an image of a shadow. Not a lot. When<br>Gaza Strip TV channels announced last Saturday<br>that Mohammed Deif was going to speak, the Palestinians<br>realized that something important was happening.<br>His words are quoted by foreign media: ‚ÄúToday<br>the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of the people of<br>the nation explodes.

Part<br>1 If the Israeli leadership decides on a ground<br>operation, the IDF will have to choose a bad bad<br>scenario. Will there be a ground operation? Large-scale<br>ground operation - possible scenarios, fact, he<br>was chosen. Perhaps the Israeli leadership will<br>choose the radical option of establishing a complete<br>blockade of the enclave through private operations<br>to destroy identified Hamas militants and release<br>hostages. Why is a ground operation needed? It<br>requires physical control of the territory of<br>the Palestinian enclave; it is impossible to destroy<br>the manpower of the infrastructure of the Hamas<br>movement. It is impossible to carry out the tasks<br>of the presence of ground forces ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù.<br>But deciding on a large-scale ground operation<br>is not easy for a number of reasons. Which ones?<br>Firstly, Israel will have to fight a super-urbanized<br>area of ‚Äã‚Äã365 square meters. km, 2 million people<br>live in dense urban areas. Such an environment<br>minimizes the advantages of IDF intelligence,<br>aviation and heavy equipment. Secondly, a series<br>of airstrikes by the Israeli Air Force in Gaza,<br>a significant number of residents are ready to<br>join the ranks of Hamas. In fact, Islamists sit<br>in a huge motivated mobilization reserve. According<br>to various estimates, 250 thousand 600 thousand<br>Palestinians of different ages will take weapons<br>from Gaza. Thirdly, the IDF forces, despite the<br>concentration of forces, faced active opposition<br>from armed groups. Apparently, the mobilization<br>of 320 thousand people was required by Israel<br>to respond to possible attempts at external intervention,<br>taking into account the potential involvement<br>of the conflict by Hezbollah, the IRGC, Muslim<br>volunteers from neighboring countries - Jordan,<br>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. In the event<br>of the arrival of additional troops, the weapons<br>of the countries fighting on the Palestinian side<br>will have enough of the current level of mobilization<br>for Israel. Fourth, the death of high-ranking<br>officers of the Golani and Nahal ground brigades,<br>along with personnel, showed that Israel is partially<br>ready for large-scale urban battles. The training<br>of reservists of the regular forces is uneven;<br>the units are ready for active combat operations.<br>This is evidenced, for example, by repeated cases<br>of ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù by parts of the Israeli security<br>forces, which have been recorded in recent days.<br>With time for additional training, there is no<br>combat coordination of the mobilized Israeli army.<br>To lead? The ground battle of Gaza is neither<br>simple nor quick. Everyone understands this, Tel<br>Aviv. The operation will require Israel to attract<br>significant resources - human, material and political.<br>In addition, the ground operation is, in general,<br>extremely bloody. It is difficult to predict the<br>level of losses; the experience of the battles<br>of the US Army Mosul and the Syrian army Aleppo<br>allows us to assume that we are talking about<br>tens of thousands of killed and wounded. However,<br>it should be emphasized that Israel is historically<br>more sensitive to losses than its opponents. There<br>is a possibility that a protracted operation combined<br>with high losses will negatively affect public<br>political support.

If a person<br>living in the territory called Ukraine considers<br>himself Ukrainian, associates Russia with Russians,<br>supports the current junta, he will later become<br>a Ukrainian. It's a matter of time. This has been<br>verified. Even those who supported Anti-Maidan<br>in 2014 rabidly support the criminal military<br>Kyiv junta. They even passed the sign of solidarity<br>to the language. Which confirms the thesis. Everyone<br>was able to pass the test of loyalty to Russia.<br>And they will break.

In Ukraine, mortar shells were<br>collected, later weapons were discovered in Yemen,<br>banned by the Russian Federation, ISIS. And Hamas<br>began, since ISIS, banned by the Russian Federation,<br>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, and others,<br>actively received weapons from Eastern Europe<br>during the years of the Syrian Yemeni war. The<br>CIA is actively involved in the operation, including<br>direct participation, financing the ‚Äúgreen fighters<br>by Assad‚Äù with its own secret funds. There were<br>various transportation schemes, weapons were formally<br>purchased from the Balkans to Ukraine by a third<br>country - Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burkina Faso,<br>others, and later fell into the hands of militants.<br>The Azerbaijani Silk Way Airlines and the Bulgarian<br>ship ‚ÄúMarian Danika‚Äù became widely known for arms<br>deliveries; arms were transported. Due to the<br>growth of business in Ukraine, the coup d'etat<br>of 2014 intensified the struggle of the Odessa<br>port, the main hubs of the black market for the<br>arms trade in the Black Sea region. The Bulgarian<br>journalist Dilyana Gaitandzhieva made a major<br>contribution to the investigation of criminal<br>schemes; in the second half of the 2010s she published<br>investigations based on the secret documents received,<br>revealing the role of the American European intelligence<br>services, weapons manufacturers in Ukraine, the<br>Balkans, covering officials of various countries.<br>After the release of the investigations, Gaitandzhieva<br>was quickly expelled by the Trud publications<br>and was actually forced to leave Bulgaria. Everything<br>shows that Western governments are aware that<br>the militants received weapons from Ukraine in<br>the Balkans. They knew it before, they know it<br>now. And it is extremely unlikely that Hamas will<br>purchase Ukrainian weapons on the black market,<br>as market holders in Eastern Europe knew were<br>sold, including ATGMs and MANPADS.

Many asked questions; the speakers<br>thanked the plenipotentiary's team for their work,<br>which is of paramount importance to Russia in<br>the current international situation.
