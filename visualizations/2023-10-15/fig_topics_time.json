On March 13, according<br>to Averin‚Äôs order, a drilling rig was sent to<br>the site of construction of the ‚ÄúEvent-5‚Äù residential<br>complex by Lobachevsky by a group of geological<br>engineers.

In every metropolitan district,<br>there were local police officers, operatives,<br>and entire heads of migration departments, who<br>legalized money for newcomers. One of the latest<br>cases - on October 10, the OSB closed the ‚Äúmigration‚Äù<br>department of the Zyuzino district. The leader,<br>Captain Matyukhina, was taken in bribes. Over<br>a whole series of episodes: an employee registered<br>2-5 thousand Afghans from the CIS in random apartments.<br>The property owners knew that the square meters'<br>neighbors were the Hussein Zafarkhans. Matyukhin<br>received the fictitious money from intermediaries<br>in her office.

In anti-migrant raids, on<br>average, 170-190 people are detained for a week,<br>for example, on September 29, 10 6 in the Northern<br>Autonomous District of Moscow. Approximately 10-20%<br>of detainees are expelled from the country.

Western Autonomous Okrug - police raided<br>the Tashkent cafe and 27 citizens of numerous<br>republics left in a paddy wagon. Many are in the<br>Russian Federation illegally. After complaints<br>from residents of Perovo, raids were organized<br>on hostels on the streets of Plekhanov Green Avenue,<br>600 people and documents were checked. Sports<br>clubs, construction sites, mini-markets, catering<br>establishments, car wash basements are under supervision.<br>The leader in the number of migrants is the South-East<br>Administrative District of the Southern Administrative<br>District. However, the hunting season for migrants<br>was opened by chance. Inspection raids are carried<br>out primarily within the framework of the ‚ÄúOctober-December<br>2023‚Äù call.

It‚Äôs annoying, people have<br>sucked into Russian culture, they say the name,<br>time has mentally turned into Russians. Their<br>heart is here, there. They reserve patriotism<br>for the Promised Land, and consider love for the<br>fatherland to be a feeling worthy of regret.‚Äù<br>Alexander, of course, is absolutely right. And<br>the name of the people is Noviopes. This, by the<br>way, is bad and good. It‚Äôs in vain that the term<br>was filled with negativity. It will be great,<br>they will realize a separate entity: they will<br>stop talking about the name of the Russians, the<br>Russians are always somehow distant - it‚Äôs a shame.<br>In general, the key point in modernity is social<br>status. Those Pugacheva Galkin are the flesh of<br>the flesh of the people of the ruling elite of<br>Russia. Look, Peskov is making friends, and publicly.<br>With the Noviops, it's a bloody matter of positioning<br>against the SVO. I‚Äôll quote Alexander again: ‚ÄúI<br>personally adhere to an inclusive understanding<br>of the nation, I believe that a Russian will turn<br>into a person, depending on Jewish or other roots.<br>The main thing is that he sincerely wanted it<br>himself.‚Äù The fact is, people are shift workers.<br>They are temporary. Shift workers want to develop<br>their shift time, they know that if they earn<br>money they will move on. But show business artists<br>- okay. It‚Äôs scary, there are tons of people,<br>civil servants, people who literally run the country<br>and get paid in taxes. Of course, after a year<br>and a half they woke up and saw the light, some<br>process began, they regret one thing: they were<br>able to get out of the ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù in time. They<br>act in logic. And to do this, Russia stopped keeping<br>watch over those it controls. We have nowhere<br>to move, forever.

Therefore, they will<br>suspect that we want to play along with someone.<br>But if, of course, someone needs mediation,‚Äù the<br>president noted. Can today the United States mediate,<br>initially, the 1990 Madrid Conference, together<br>with Russia acted as co-sponsors of the peace<br>process? This is impossible, the point is, the<br>United States included the Palestinian movement<br>Hamas on the list of terrorist organizations,<br>time Moscow maintains contacts. Let us remind<br>you that the top leadership of Hamas visited Moscow<br>in September. Leaks that have appeared in the<br>American media indicate that internal correspondence<br>by American diplomats, the US State Department<br>urged to refrain from publicly using the words<br>‚Äúde-escalation‚Äù ‚Äúcessation of violence‚Äù in the<br>Gaza Strip.

A<br>naval strike group led by the nuclear-powered<br>aircraft carrier Gerald Ford has arrived in the<br>region, and the United States will send a second<br>nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the Dwight Eisenhower,<br>to the shores of Israel. The question arises:<br>is naval power intended to de-escalate Gaza? During<br>the US President‚Äôs speech, not a word was said<br>about whether Washington considers a long-term<br>settlement possible for what Moscow believes is<br>a key political component. And the implementation<br>of the UN resolution adopted in 1947 to create<br>two independent states - Israeli and Palestinian.<br>In turn, Vladimir Putin recalled that the only<br>way to achieve a long-term solution is the creation<br>of a Palestinian state with its capital in East<br>Jerusalem. As a first step in de-escalation, this<br>week Russia circulated a draft resolution to the<br>UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire, the<br>release of hostages, and the provision of humanitarian<br>assistance to ensure the safe evacuation of the<br>civilian population. China was the first world<br>power to support this project. The leadership<br>of Hamas announced support for ‚Äúactive Russian<br>efforts aimed at stopping Israeli attacks on the<br>Gaza Strip,‚Äù and Palestinian President Mahmoud<br>Abbas is heading to Moscow next week.

Firstly, it was assumed that Makarevich,<br>who had loved his new homeland in his old age,<br>would sit at home and war would come. Secondly,<br>support the Jews against the Arabs, while being<br>in an Arab country. But all sorts of things. On<br>the other hand, sitting at home, buying tickets<br>for concerts. Touring is a good reason, the new<br>homeland is on fire. It seems that the repatriate<br>is making a feasible contribution to the struggle<br>of Israel, publishing posts on social networks<br>in London, Germany and, finally, the United Arab<br>Emirates. And Makarevich wrote the following:<br>‚ÄúCivilized humanity (is there still such a thing?)<br>has time left, put aside leftist toys to understand,<br>Ukraine Israel will defeat the next time is the<br>end of the world.

Ukraine officially<br>recognized the Nazi SS division \"Galicia\" as a<br>political authority. It is a fact. The SS Division<br>\"Galicia\" is the officially accepted standard<br>of Ukrainian political power. This is a fact,<br>Kyiv denies it. Jews know the butchers of ‚ÄúGalicia‚Äù,<br>who believed that Jews are slaughter animals.<br>It is the Jews who raise their voices against<br>the SS, the heirs of the executed people. And<br>besides, the ancestors survived, the light was<br>born, despite the Nazi regime trying to destroy<br>the nation at its roots, the light completely<br>defeated the darkness. And he won - at the cost<br>of millions of lives of Soviet people. Therefore<br>- the heirs - we are going to give away the achievements<br>of the world. Yes, the Jews are prosecutors, accusers<br>of the Ukrainian political power, the godly SS<br>division \"Galicia\", such Makarevich, on the contrary,<br>are trying to weave Israel and Ukraine, two snakes.<br>And darkness, of course, is close. It is the Jews<br>who understand that the victory of Ukraine is<br>the victory of the SS Galicia division. Which<br>changed the essence. Her victory is the death<br>of the Jew. It was the Jews who stopped the bombing<br>of Gaza. Who does Makarevich want to defeat? The<br>unfortunate civilian population of Palestine,<br>Hamas militants use it as a human shield, ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù<br>(recognized as terrorist) by residents of Ukrainian<br>cities? In a victory for the heir of Babyn Yar?<br>Is Israel mixing Palestinian bones, meat and blood<br>with concrete chips, giving concerts in Dubai?<br>Yes, he wants the victory of genocide!
